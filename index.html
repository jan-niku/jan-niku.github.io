    <div class="abstract-container">
        <div class="abstract-box">
            <p>A fundamental component of epidemiological modeling, the continuous SIR model, attempts to model the spread of a contagion using systems of differential equations. These base models rely on an assumption of full, constant interaction between individuals. This assumption may poorly reflect more sparse interaction networks. As literature suggests that small-world networks are good approximations of human relations, we expand SIR to these networks. We compare peak infections of continuous SIR models to those predicted by simulations on small world networks with varying degrees of node clustering. We then minimize a cost function comparing infection peaks between these two models by varying the infection rate in the continuous SIR. We show a compensatory factor exists for this infection rate, allowing infections in a network to be approximated using a much simpler continuous model.
            <br><br>
                Image - As we increase the number of connections in a network, the development of the infection approaches that of a fully connected model. Can we move the other way, compensating a fully-connected model to approach a poorly-connected network?

    <div class="abstract-container">
        <div class="abstract-box">
            <p>Can birds sing like humans? Are some birdsongs more melodic? Intrigued by <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1406023111">a paper</a>, we sought to reproduce then reapproach the results. An attribute of human musical scales and notes is the presence of overtones: a selection of notes which are multiples of some base frequency. We used Fourier transforms to extract frequencies present in bird records, requiring well-isolated frequency-space 'peaks' to identify well-represented notes, and reject sliding or unclear components of songs. We then attempted to describe present notes by assuming they are well-described as overtones of some fundamental, to-be-determined frequency. We search for the best fundamental frequency using the error of existing notes from the closest overtone. We were able to confirm the results of the paper: thrushes are unusually 'melodic', with a preference for overtones.
            <br><br>
            Image - Presence of overtones is seen as a very human-like feature. How well can overtones describe identified notes? We scan through possible fundamental frequencies to minimize SSE: the search for a 'reference pitch' of the birds scale.

            <p>The Direct Potable Reuse trailer treats wastewater to drinkable quality and educates the community about local and sustainable water treatment. It is important for the operators of the trailer to be able to identify when faults occur in the system, specifically using the data from the Biologically Active Filtration and Microfiltration Membrane processes. This brief focuses on determining the normal operating conditions of the trailer through data visualization and suggests methods for fault detection through functional data analysis.
