            <p>Abstract â€“ A fundamental component of epidemiological
                modeling, the continuous SIR model, attempts to model
                the spread of a contagion using systems of differential
                equations. These base models rely on an assumption of full,
                constant interaction between individuals. This assumption
                may poorly reflect more sparse interaction networks. As
                literature suggests that small-world networks are good
                approximations of human relations, we expand SIR to
                these networks. We compare peak infections of continuous
                SIR models to those predicted by simulations on small
                world networks with varying degrees of node clustering.
                We then minimize a cost function comparing infection
                peaks between these two models by varying the infection
                rate in the continuous SIR. We show a compensatory
                factor exists for this infection rate, allowing infections
                in a network to be approximated using a much simpler
                continuous model.</p>
